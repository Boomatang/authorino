## Requirements

- Kubernetes server

Create a containerized Kubernetes server locally using [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io):

```sh
kind create cluster --name authorino-tutorial
```

## 1. Install the Authorino Operator

```sh
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kuadrant/authorino-operator/main/utils/install.sh | bash -s
```

## 2. Deploy the Talker API

The **Talker API** is just an echo API, included in the Authorino examples. We will use it in this guide as the service to be protected with Authorino.

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kuadrant/authorino-examples/main/talker-api/talker-api-deploy.yaml
```

## 3. Deploy Authorino

```sh
kubectl apply -f -<<EOF
apiVersion: operator.authorino.kuadrant.io/v1beta1
kind: Authorino
metadata:
  name: authorino
spec:
  listener:
    tls:
      enabled: false
  oidcServer:
    tls:
      enabled: false
EOF
```

The command above will deploy Authorino as a separate service (as opposed to a sidecar of the protected API and other architectures), in `namespaced` reconciliation mode, and with TLS termination disabled. For other variants and deployment options, check out the [Getting Started](./../getting-started.md#step-request-an-authorino-instance) section of the docs, the [Architecture](./../architecture.md#topologies) page, and the spec for the [`Authorino`](https://github.com/Kuadrant/authorino-operator/blob/main/config/crd/bases/operator.authorino.kuadrant.io_authorinos.yaml) CRD in the Authorino Operator repo.

## 4. Setup Envoy

The following bundle from the Authorino examples (manifest referred in the command below) is to apply Envoy configuration and deploy Envoy proxy, that wire up the Talker API behind the reverse-proxy and external authorization with the Authorino instance.

For details and instructions to setup Envoy manually, see _Protect a service > Setup Envoy_ in the [Getting Started](./../getting-started.md#step-setup-envoy) page. For a simpler and straightforward way to manage an API, without having to manually install or configure Envoy and Authorino, check out [Kuadrant](https://github.com/kuadrant).

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kuadrant/authorino-examples/main/envoy/envoy-notls-deploy.yaml
```

The bundle also creates an `Ingress` with host name `talker-api-authorino.127.0.0.1.nip.io`, but if you are using a local Kubernetes cluster created with Kind, you need to forward requests on port 8000 to inside the cluster in order to actually reach the Envoy service:

```sh
kubectl port-forward deployment/envoy 8000:8000 &
```

## 5. Create the `AuthConfig`

```sh
kubectl apply -f -<<EOF
apiVersion: authorino.kuadrant.io/v1beta2
kind: AuthConfig
metadata:
  name: talker-api-protection
spec:
  hosts:
  - talker-api-authorino.127.0.0.1.nip.io
  authentication:
    "public":
      anonymous: {}
EOF
```

The example above enables anonymous access (i.e. removes authentication), without adding any extra layer of protection to the API. This is virtually equivalent to setting a top-level [condition](./../features.md#common-feature-conditions-when) to the `AuthConfig` that always skips the configuration, or to switching authentication/authorization off completely in the route to the API.

For more sophisticated use cases of anonymous access with Authorino, consider combining this feature with other identity sources in the `AuthConfig` while playing with the [priorities](./../features.md#common-feature-priorities) of each source, as well as combination with `when` [conditions](./../features.md#common-feature-conditions-when), and/or adding authorization policies that either cover authentication or address anonymous access with proper rules (e.g. enforcing read-only access).

Check out the docs for the [Anonymous access](./../features.md#anonymous-access-authenticationanonymous) feature for an example of an `AuthConfig` that falls back to anonymous access when a priority OIDC/JWT-based authentication fails, and enforces a read-only policy in such cases.

## 6. Consume the API

```sh
curl http://talker-api-authorino.127.0.0.1.nip.io:8000/hello
# HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

## Cleanup

If you have started a Kubernetes cluster locally with Kind to try this user guide, delete it by running:

```sh
kind delete cluster --name authorino-tutorial
```

Otherwise, delete the resources created in each step:

```sh
kubectl delete authconfig/talker-api-protection
kubectl delete authorino/authorino
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kuadrant/authorino-examples/main/envoy/envoy-notls-deploy.yaml
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kuadrant/authorino-examples/main/talker-api/talker-api-deploy.yaml
```

To uninstall the Authorino Operator and manifests (CRDs, RBAC, etc), run:

```sh
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kuadrant/authorino-operator/main/config/deploy/manifests.yaml
```
